To provide a better out-of-the-box experience, we will bundle a set of example images (lightweight SVGs/placeholders) with the application.\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n1.  **Assets:** Create a directory `src-tauri/resources/example-photos` containing generated SVG images (e.g., abstract patterns or stylized kittens).\n2.  **Bundling:** Update `src-tauri/crates/app/tauri.conf.json` to include this directory in the `bundle.resources` configuration.\n3.  **Runtime Resolution:**\n    -   In `PhotoSlideshowPlugin.tsx`, logic will be added to detect if the user hasn't configured a path.\n    -   If unconfigured, it will attempt to resolve the bundled `example-photos` resource path using Tauri's path API.\n    -   This resolved path will be used as the source for the slideshow.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n-   **Resource Path:** In dev, it maps to the source dir.

{"id":"vc-mol-8w8","title":"Better testing of flows","description":"A system-test is needed that will run through a good portion of the features end-to-end is needed as a final verification step. This needs a lot of support, from instructing the control plane, running the remote, checking the visualization window for effects, and so on. This would be used for releases, and for verification of larger work to make sure the program still works as intended\n\n## Context \u0026 Analysis\n(Added by Agent on 2026-01-09)\n\nThe goal is to implement a comprehensive system-test (E2E) that verifies the interaction between the Control Plane, Remote, and Visualizer.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- The Visualizer runs in a separate Tauri WebView, making direct DOM access or screenshotting difficult without heavy tools like Selenium/WebDriver.\n- Standard E2E tests (like the existing `e2e_test.sh`) only verify the API/Server state, not whether the Visualizer is actually responding or rendering.\n\n**Proposed Architecture: Loopback Telemetry**\nTo achieve 'flow testing' without browser automation overhead:\n1.  **Backend (`vibe-cast-server`)**: Add a dedicated E2E API (`/api/e2e/*`).\n    -   `POST /api/e2e/report`: Receives status reports from the frontend.\n    -   `GET /api/e2e/last-report`: endpoint for the test runner to verify frontend state.\n2.  **Frontend (`VisualizerWindow.tsx`)**: Implement a 'Test Hook'.\n    -   Listen for a `report-status` command.\n    -   On receipt, gather internal state (active component, current messages, frame counts) and `POST` it to the backend's E2E reporting endpoint.\n3.  **Test Runner**: A Node.js or Vitest script that:\n    -   Launches the app.\n    -   Connects to SSE.\n    -   Sends commands (e.g., 'Set Mode to Fireplace').\n    -   Sends 'Report Status' command.\n    -   Verifies the report confirms 'Fireplace' is active.\n\nThis approach verifies the full loop: Command -\u003e Server -\u003e SSE/Event -\u003e Visualizer -\u003e Render Logic -\u003e Feedback -\u003e Server -\u003e Test Assertion.\n\n## Relevant Code \u0026 Tests\n(Added by Agent on 2026-01-09)\n\n**Backend:**\n- `src-tauri/crates/server/src/lib.rs`: Main server entry point. Needs new routes (`/api/e2e/*`).\n- `src-tauri/crates/models/src/lib.rs`: Add `E2EReport` struct.\n- `src-tauri/crates/state/src/lib.rs`: Add `e2e_reports` storage to `AppStateSync`.\n\n**Frontend:**\n- `src/components/VisualizerWindow.tsx`: Add listener for `report-status` command and logic to POST report.\n- `src/store.ts`: Might need to expose store state for the report.\n\n**Tests:**\n- `scripts/e2e_test.sh`: Existing smoke test.\n- `scripts/e2e_flow_test.js` (New): Node.js script for the complex flow test.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-08T16:31:36.211608+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-09T23:11:07.698416+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T23:11:07.698416+01:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

This will be used as a way to demo all the transitions, so it is important that the normal photo slideshow and the Transition demo slideshow use that same transitions and settings for that.\n\n## Context \u0026 Analysis\n(Added by Agent on 2026-01-10)\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n1.  **Shared Logic**: Transition logic (types, styles, helper functions) has been extracted to `src/plugins/visualizations/utils/transitions.ts` to ensure consistency between the standard slideshow and the demo.\n2.  **New Plugin**: `TransitionDemoPlugin` will be created in `src/plugins/visualizations/TransitionDemoPlugin.tsx`.\n3.  **Implementation Details**:\n    -   **Settings**: Reuses the same schema as `PhotoSlideshowPlugin` to ensure parity.\n    -   **Grid Layout**: Dynamically calculates grid dimensions (rows/cols) based on the number of enabled transitions.\n    -   **Synchronization**: Uses a single state (index, timer) to drive all cells simultaneously.\n    -   **Performance**: Since the same image is displayed in all cells, we only load/decode it once and reuse the Blob URL. This mitigates the performance cost of rendering multiple instances.\n    -   **Visuals**: Each cell displays the name of the transition (e.g., \"Fade\", \"Slide Left\") overlaid on the content.\n\n**Architectural Considerations:**\n-   **Code Reuse**: Maximized by extracting transition logic.\n-   **Resource Usage**: While image memory is shared, rendering many CSS transitions/animations simultaneously (especially 3D transforms) may have GPU impact.

There should be an example folder of messages with three parts: 1) Countdown initiated... in typewriter, 2) 3, 2, 1 split on comma with bounce and 1 second per part, 3) large scrolling capitals centered with It's time to party 🥳\n\n## Context \u0026 Analysis\n\nDefaults are defined in two places and need to be synchronized:\n1.  **Backend (Rust)**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` in `AppStateSync::new()`. This provides the initial state sent via SSE.\n2.  **Frontend (React)**: `src/config/defaultConfig.json`. This is used for `resetToDefaults` and initial local state.\n\n**Required Changes:**\n\n### Visualization Presets\n1.  **Standard Fireplace**: Keep existing.\n2.  **Blue Glow Fireplace**:\n    *   Visualization: `fireplace`\n    *   Settings: `showLogs: false`, `emberCount: 0`, `flameCount: 0`, `glowColor: '#1e3a8a'`\n3.  **Slideshow**:\n    *   Visualization: `photo-slideshow`\n    *   Settings: Placeholder for local path or instruction.\n4.  **Particles (Calm/Large)**:\n    *   Visualization: `particles`\n    *   Settings: `particleSize: 5`, `speed: 0.5`\n5.  **YouTube**: Keep existing.\n6.  **Techno (No Blob)**:\n    *   Visualization: `techno`\n    *   Settings: `showSphere: false`, `showBars: true`\n\n### Text Style Presets\n1.  **Scrolling Capitals Centered**:\n    *   Style: `scrolling-capitals`\n    *   Settings: `position: 'center'`, `fontSize: 12`\n\n### Messages \u0026 Folders\n*   Create a message tree with a folder named 'Party Countdown'.\n*   **Message 1**: 'Countdown initiated...', Style: `typewriter`\n*   **Message 2**: '3, 2, 1', Style: `bounce`, `splitEnabled: true`, `splitSeparator: ','`, `speed: 1.0`\n*   **Message 3**: 'It'\\''s time to party 🥳', Style: `scrolling-capitals` (use the centered preset)\n\n## Relevant Code \u0026 Tests\n\n*   **Backend Defaults**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` -\u003e `AppStateSync::new()`\n*   **Frontend Defaults**: `src/config/defaultConfig.json`\n*   **Plugins**:\n    *   `src/plugins/visualizations/FireplacePlugin.tsx`\n    *   `src/plugins/visualizations/TechnoPlugin.tsx`\n    *   `src/plugins/visualizations/ParticlesPlugin.tsx`\n    *   `src/plugins/textStyles/ScrollingCapitalsPlugin.tsx`\n*   **Tests**: `src/__tests__/configSerialization.test.ts`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-08T16:02:27.538963+01:00","created_by":"zayenz","updated_at":"2026-01-08T16:52:05.993998+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T16:52:05.993998+01:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
