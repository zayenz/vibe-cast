{"id":"vc-mol-8w8","title":"Better testing of flows","description":"A system-test is needed that will run through a good portion of the features end-to-end is needed as a final verification step. This needs a lot of support, from instructing the control plane, running the remote, checking the visualization window for effects, and so on. This would be used for releases, and for verification of larger work to make sure the program still works as intended\n\n## Context \u0026 Analysis\n(Added by Agent on 2026-01-09)\n\nThe goal is to implement a comprehensive system-test (E2E) that verifies the interaction between the Control Plane, Remote, and Visualizer.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- The Visualizer runs in a separate Tauri WebView, making direct DOM access or screenshotting difficult without heavy tools like Selenium/WebDriver.\n- Standard E2E tests (like the existing `e2e_test.sh`) only verify the API/Server state, not whether the Visualizer is actually responding or rendering.\n\n**Proposed Architecture: Loopback Telemetry**\nTo achieve 'flow testing' without browser automation overhead:\n1.  **Backend (`vibe-cast-server`)**: Add a dedicated E2E API (`/api/e2e/*`).\n    -   `POST /api/e2e/report`: Receives status reports from the frontend.\n    -   `GET /api/e2e/last-report`: endpoint for the test runner to verify frontend state.\n2.  **Frontend (`VisualizerWindow.tsx`)**: Implement a 'Test Hook'.\n    -   Listen for a `report-status` command.\n    -   On receipt, gather internal state (active component, current messages, frame counts) and `POST` it to the backend's E2E reporting endpoint.\n3.  **Test Runner**: A Node.js or Vitest script that:\n    -   Launches the app.\n    -   Connects to SSE.\n    -   Sends commands (e.g., 'Set Mode to Fireplace').\n    -   Sends 'Report Status' command.\n    -   Verifies the report confirms 'Fireplace' is active.\n\nThis approach verifies the full loop: Command -\u003e Server -\u003e SSE/Event -\u003e Visualizer -\u003e Render Logic -\u003e Feedback -\u003e Server -\u003e Test Assertion.\n\n## Relevant Code \u0026 Tests\n(Added by Agent on 2026-01-09)\n\n**Backend:**\n- `src-tauri/crates/server/src/lib.rs`: Main server entry point. Needs new routes (`/api/e2e/*`).\n- `src-tauri/crates/models/src/lib.rs`: Add `E2EReport` struct.\n- `src-tauri/crates/state/src/lib.rs`: Add `e2e_reports` storage to `AppStateSync`.\n\n**Frontend:**\n- `src/components/VisualizerWindow.tsx`: Add listener for `report-status` command and logic to POST report.\n- `src/store.ts`: Might need to expose store state for the report.\n\n**Tests:**\n- `scripts/e2e_test.sh`: Existing smoke test.\n- `scripts/e2e_flow_test.js` (New): Node.js script for the complex flow test.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-08T16:31:36.211608+01:00","updated_at":"2026-01-09T23:11:07.698416+01:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T23:11:07.698416+01:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
