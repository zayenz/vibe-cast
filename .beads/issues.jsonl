It works well in development mode.\n\nThis is quite likely because of the difference in how the visualization window is opened in production, where it is re-started in order to make a fix for youtbue playback. Note, youtbue playback should still be working without error 153 in production builds\n\nAs a part of this work, a comprehensive testing strategy needs to be developed, so it is possible to test without a human in the loop.\n","status":"in_progress","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-07T17:46:46.69291+01:00","created_by":"zayenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T18:08:45.991307+01:00"}
